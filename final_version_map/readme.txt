### Requirements to run the Jupyter Notebook ###

Install folium, geopy, lxml, pandas by using: pip install {package}

### Usage ###

This notebook has to be ran in order for it to work. Some cells can take a while to complete. All directories are relative to the folder the notebook is in, be careful of that.

For understanding purposes, these cells sometimes output text or tables.


If the geopy package does not work, in this folder a file locaties1.tsv is included. If this is read in and converted to a dictionary, it can work as a replacement.
